From my heart to yours 
Community Table is a dream that dropped into my heart a few years ago. From the time I was young, I have longed to see people from every walk of life come together in a way that is supportive, heart-felt, and empowering. The image which conveys my vision best would be that of an endlessly long table filled with shining faces and open hearts, honoring one another, sharing resources, enjoying fellowship, and finding meaning in life. God has asked us all to pull up to his table and be part of his family and we want to extend that invitation through Community Table.~Michelle

* Community garden
* Cooking, canning classes
* Showers for homeless and others in needs
* Laundry facility available for those in need
* Possible thrift store or other business 
* Groups to aid in emotional and spiritual healing
* Opportunity to attend a weekly worship service

Bright Spot Basket Deliveries   Jan. 10, 2017


Thank you for taking time to connect with us here at Community Table.  We recently made some Bright Spot Baskets to give to people in our neighborhood that we had not connected with before and a few to shut-ins that we enjoy and want them to continue knowing they are loved and cared for.  We hope to do more of these type activities in the near future. 


A couple of pictures of the baskets, I can resend if needed.
















We do have some current needs that we would like to share:


Elderly lady in Elizabethton needs help with grocery shopping, occasional doctor’s visits, and some light housework, mainly vacuuming. 


Older gentleman in Elizabethton needs help with getting extensive repairs done on his home including wiring, sheet rock, siding, a front porch rebuilt, etc.  If you can help or can connect us to a resource that can, we would be most appreciative. I can be reached at info@communitytabletn.org.




Thanks again, and I hope this is a wonderfully blessed year for everyone!


My verse for this season is the following:  For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,  Rom. 14:7 (NIV)


Peace and Love,
